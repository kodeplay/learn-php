Introduction to Object Oriented Programming in PHP
==================================================


What is OOP ?
-------------

Object oriented programming is a philosophy or an approach for
designing computer applications or programs. The core concept
of oop is use of complex data types to create objects. So 
your program during it's execution will have many objects
which are capable of communicating with each other by sending
and receiving messages there by acting on data. Objects help
each other to acheive the end goal.


Problems OOP strives to solve
-----------------------------

Here are some of the problems (in plain english!) that oop solves or rather
strives to solve

* Reduce duplicate code and improve reusability.

* Provide a custom data type for complex data.

* Mapping data to real world complex types eg. Bank Account

* Providing, maintaining and sharing state

* Give modularity to your application by providing container 
  for related data

* Better Code organization


OOP in PHP
----------

In PHP, which is originally a procedural language, OOP support was not
built in the language from start but was added later. Hence it doesn't
emulate true OO capabilities. Due to this, OOP approach in PHP feels
inferior to other programming languages where OOP support is baked
into the language right from the start eg. Java, Python.

This also means that when using OOP in PHP, it's important to know the 
limitations otherwise it will result in poor design decisions.

The best way to make up for the disadvantages and pain points of using 
OOP in PHP is to know it thoroughly and use it wisely.

Finally, it's easy which means it's easy to make do it the wrong way
too. Also, a lot of times OOP isn't the most elegant solution or 
often an overkill. So it's important to spot such cases early on.


It's all about objects!
-----------------------

They

* represent things (data) that your code cares about

* have Attributes

* can behave (via methods)
